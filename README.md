##Diacare Diacare is a React Native app designed to help diabetic patients manage their condition. With Diacare, patients can easily track their blood sugar levels, monitor their medication intake, and keep track of their diet and exercise habits. The app features an intuitive user interface that allows patients to input their data quickly and easily.

One of the key benefits of Diacare is its ability to provide patients with personalized feedback and recommendations based on their data.
